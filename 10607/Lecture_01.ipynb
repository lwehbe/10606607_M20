We will define a set of arithmetic operations that will allow us to combine such propositions to build other propositions and write proofs. We have logical connectives $\\vee$, $\\wedge$, $\\neg$, $\\rightarrow$ and $\\iff$. We also have truth values T (sometimes referred to with $\\top$) or F (sometimes referred to with $\\bot$, called falsehood, absurdity or contradiction).\n"

    "## Inference rules and proofs\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with statements in propositional logic, we use inference rules. The most famous of these is probably modus ponens: from premises $p$ and $p→q$, conclude $q$.\n",

    "\\text{mortal(Socrates) }    &    \\text{[modus ponens; 1, 2]}\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "\n",
    "The format above is often called a \"two-column proof\": we write statements in the left column, and their justifications in the right column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lemmas\n",
    "The above proof demonstrates the statement\n",
    "\n",
    "man(Socrates)∧(man(Socrates)→mortal(Socrates))→mortal(Socrates) \n",
    "\n",
    "To see why, collect all of the proof's assumptions together with ∧, take the last line of the proof as the final conclusion, and write \"assumptions → conclusion\".  (We could actually have taken any line of the proof as the conclusion, but conventionally we put the conclusion last.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This process — summarizing a proof or part of a proof by collecting together its assumptions and conclusion — is called \"implication introduction\" or \"proving a lemma\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "To go with implication introduction, modus ponens is sometimes called \"implication elimination.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other inference rules\n",
    "There are lots of useful inference rules besides implication introduction and implication elimination.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\wedge$ introduction: if we separately prove $p$ and $q$, then that constitutes a proof of $p \\wedge q$.\n",
    "- $\\wedge$ elimination: from $p\\wedge q$ we can conclude either of $p$ and $q$ separately.\n",
    "- $\\vee$ introduction: from $p$ we can conclude $p\\vee q$ for any $q$.\n",
    "- $\\vee$ elimination (also called proof by cases): if we know $p\\vee q$ (the cases) and we have both $p\\vee r$  and $p\\vee r$  (the case-specific proofs), then we can conclude $r$.\n",
    "- T introduction: we can conclude T from no assumptions.\n",
    "- F elimination: from F we can conclude an arbitrary formula $p$. \n",
    "- Associativity: both $\\wedge$ and $\\vee$ are associative: it doesn't matter how we parenthesize an expression like $a\\wedge b\\wedge c\\wedge d$. (So in fact we often just leave the parentheses out in such cases. But when having $\\vee$ and $\\wedge$ together, it's a good idea to keep the parentheses.)\n",
    "- Distributivity: $\\wedge$ and $\\vee$ distribute over one another; for example, $a\\wedge(b\\vee c)$  is equivalent to $(a\\vee b)\\wedge(a\\vee c)$.\n",
    "- Commutativity: both $\\wedge$ and $\\vee$ are commutative (symmetric in the order of their arguments), so we can re-order their arguments however we please.  For example, $a\\wedge b\\wedge c$ is equivalent to $c\\wedge b\\wedge a$.\n",
