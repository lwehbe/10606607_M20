We will define a set of arithmetic operations that will allow us to combine such propositions to build other propositions and write proofs. We have logical connectives $\\vee$, $\\wedge$, $\\neg$, $\\rightarrow$ and $\\iff$. We also have truth values T (sometimes referred to with $\\top$) or F (sometimes referred to with $\\bot$, called falsehood, absurdity or contradiction).\n"

    "## Inference rules and proofs\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with statements in propositional logic, we use inference rules. The most famous of these is probably modus ponens: from premises $p$ and $p→q$, conclude $q$.\n",

    "\\end{array}\n",
    "\n",
    "The format above is often called a \"two-column proof\": we write statements in the left column, and their justifications in the right column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lemmas\n",
    "The above proof demonstrates the statement\n",
    "\n",
    "man(Socrates)∧(man(Socrates)→mortal(Socrates))→mortal(Socrates) \n",
    "\n",
    "To see why, collect all of the proof's assumptions together with ∧, take the last line of the proof as the final conclusion, and write \"assumptions → conclusion\".  (We could actually have taken any line of the proof as the conclusion, but conventionally we put the conclusion last.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This process — summarizing a proof or part of a proof by collecting together its assumptions and conclusion — is called \"implication introduction\" or \"proving a lemma\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "To go with implication introduction, modus ponens is sometimes called \"implication elimination.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other inference rules\n",
    "There are lots of useful inference rules besides implication introduction and implication elimination.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\wedge$ introduction: if we separately prove $p$ and $q$, then that constitutes a proof of $p \\wedge q$.\n",
    "- $\\wedge$ elimination: from $p\\wedge q$ we can conclude either of $p$ and $q$ separately.\n",
    "- $\\vee$ introduction: from $p$ we can conclude $p\\vee q$ for any $q$.\n",
    "- $\\vee$ elimination (also called proof by cases): if we know $p\\vee q$ (the cases) and we have both $p\\vee r$  and $p\\vee r$  (the case-specific proofs), then we can conclude $r$.\n",
    "- T introduction: we can conclude T from no assumptions.\n",
    "- F elimination: from F we can conclude an arbitrary formula $p$. \n",
    "- Associativity: both $\\wedge$ and $\\vee$ are associative: it doesn't matter how we parenthesize an expression like $a\\wedge b\\wedge c\\wedge d$. (So in fact we often just leave the parentheses out in such cases. But when having $\\vee$ and $\\wedge$ together, it's a good idea to keep the parentheses.)\n",
    "- Distributivity: $\\wedge$ and $\\vee$ distribute over one another; for example, $a\\wedge(b\\vee c)$  is equivalent to $(a\\vee b)\\wedge(a\\vee c)$.\n",
    "- Commutativity: both $\\wedge$ and $\\vee$ are commutative (symmetric in the order of their arguments), so we can re-order their arguments however we please.  For example, $a\\wedge b\\wedge c$ is equivalent to $c\\wedge b\\wedge a$.\n",

    "Prove: $(a\\wedge b)\\rightarrow(b\\wedge a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional rules for classical logic:\n",
    "(in classical logic we force statments to be either true or false. We will focus in this class on classical logic. In constructive logic, it might be the case that we cannot prove either $p$ or $\\neg p$.\n",
