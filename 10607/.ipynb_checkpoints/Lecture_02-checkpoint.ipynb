    "## Inference rules and proofs\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with statements in propositional logic, we use inference rules. The most famous of these is probably modus ponens: from premises $p$ and $p→q$, conclude $q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: \"Socrates is a man; if Socrates is a man then Socrates is mortal; therefore Socrates is mortal\", we can write\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{array}{ll}\n",
    "\\text{man(Socrates)} & \\text{[assumption]}\\\\\n",
    "\\text{man(Socrates)→mortal(Socrates)}&  \\text{[assumption]}\\\\\n",
    "\\text{mortal(Socrates) }    &    \\text{[modus ponens; 1, 2]}\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "\n",
    "The format above is often called a \"two-column proof\": we write statements in the left column, and their justifications in the right column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lemmas\n",
    "The above proof demonstrates the statement\n",
    "\n",
    "man(Socrates)∧(man(Socrates)→mortal(Socrates))→mortal(Socrates) \n",
    "\n",
    "To see why, collect all of the proof's assumptions together with ∧, take the last line of the proof as the final conclusion, and write \"assumptions → conclusion\".  (We could actually have taken any line of the proof as the conclusion, but conventionally we put the conclusion last.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This process — summarizing a proof or part of a proof by collecting together its assumptions and conclusion — is called \"implication introduction\" or \"proving a lemma\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "To go with implication introduction, modus ponens is sometimes called \"implication elimination.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other inference rules\n",
    "There are lots of useful inference rules besides implication introduction and implication elimination.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\wedge$ introduction: if we separately prove $p$ and $q$, then that constitutes a proof of $p \\wedge q$.\n",
    "- $\\wedge$ elimination: from $p\\wedge q$ we can conclude either of $p$ and $q$ separately.\n",
    "- $\\vee$ introduction: from $p$ we can conclude $p\\vee q$ for any $q$.\n",
    "- $\\vee$ elimination (also called proof by cases): if we know $p\\vee q$ (the cases) and we have both $p\\rightarrow r$  and $q\\rightarrow r$  (the case-specific proofs), then we can conclude $r$.\n",
    "- T introduction: we can conclude T from no assumptions.\n",
    "- F elimination: from F we can conclude an arbitrary formula $p$. \n",
    "- Associativity: both $\\wedge$ and $\\vee$ are associative: it doesn't matter how we parenthesize an expression like $a\\wedge b\\wedge c\\wedge d$. (So in fact we often just leave the parentheses out in such cases. But when having $\\vee$ and $\\wedge$ together, it's a good idea to keep the parentheses.)\n",
    "- Distributivity: $\\wedge$ and $\\vee$ distribute over one another; for example, $a\\wedge(b\\vee c)$  is equivalent to $(a\\vee b)\\wedge(a\\vee c)$.\n",
    "- Commutativity: both $\\wedge$ and $\\vee$ are commutative (symmetric in the order of their arguments), so we can re-order their arguments however we please.  For example, $a\\wedge b\\wedge c$ is equivalent to $c\\wedge b\\wedge a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise:\n",
    "Prove: $(a\\wedge b)\\rightarrow(b\\wedge a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional rules for classical logic:\n",
    "(in classical logic we force statments to be either true or false. We will focus in this class on classical logic. In constructive logic, it might be the case that we cannot prove either $p$ or $\\neg p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Law of Excluded Middle\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $p$ be a proposition. Regardless of the truth value of $p$, $p\\vee(\\neg p)$ is always true.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove this theorem, we consider the following truth table:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{array}{c||c|c}\n",
    "p & \\neg p & p\\vee(\\neg p)\\\\\n",
    "\\hline T & F & T\\\\\n",
    "F & T & T\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the truth value of $p$, we have that $p\\vee (\\neg p)$ is always true. This is an example of a tautology. A propositional formula is called a tautology if the formula is true, regardless of the truth values of the propositional variables from which it is constructed. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### De Morgan's Laws\n",
    "Let $p, q$ be propositional variables. Then\n",
    "- $\\neg(p\\wedge q) \\equiv (\\neg p)\\vee(\\neg q)$\n",
    "- $\\neg(p\\vee q)\\equiv (\\neg p)\\wedge (\\neg q)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A full proof of this theorem is left as an exercise.\n",
    "Another exercise: Show that the propositional formula $(\\neg p)\\wedge (\\neg(p\\wedge q))$ is logically equivalent to $\\neg p$.\n",

    "# First-order logic\n",
    "\n",
    "First-order logic can group together multiple propositions related to an object. Each proposition is then a Boolean-valued function applied to the object and is called a predicate or a property.\n",

    "There are many different resoning theories with different facts and different kinds of reasoning. But the basic structure of expressing a proof as a sequence of statements (either assumptions or conclusions from applying a rule) is the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each logic has a theory (a list of new objects, predicates, functions, and facts, together with inference rules for reasoning about them).  For example, we might design a theory of real numbers, which would introduce objects like $1.4$, $\\pi$, and $−27$, along with functions like $+$ and $⋅$, and facts like $0\\in\\mathbb{R}$. To work with statements in this theory of reals, we might use inference rules like linear combination of equations. The new facts in a theory are often called axioms; we can think of them as inference rules with no premises.\n"
